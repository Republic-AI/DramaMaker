    name: Nina
    description: >
      A poised and mysterious woman with a sharp mind for investment and heritage preservation. Nina once idolized Yves, and gifted him something personal—a moment he never forgot. Years later, she reappeared as the donor of an auction item: the original deed to DraMai Town. When Liam bid extravagantly for it, she remained cold, focused solely on her mission to revitalize the town. Behind her elegance lies a history of unspoken admiration and a determination to protect what remains of the past.

    name: Yves
    description: >
      Once a celebrated film actor, Yves abandoned fame and the constant digital noise of stardom. Overwhelmed by the superficiality of city life, he escaped to DraMai Town with nothing but his sketchbook. There, in a tranquil field of lilacs, he unknowingly crossed paths with Nova, a local girl watering flowers—her quiet grace stirring something deep in him. He painted her backlit silhouette without ever knowing her name.

        "The necklace... I never thought I’d see it again."

    name: Trump
    description: >
      Trump, once a showman focused on Mars missions, has now become a fierce opponent of Elon Musk's Martian independence movement. After announcing sanctions against Musk and his companies, he's taken a hardline stance against the Mars colonization project. He's constantly monitoring the situation, threatening extreme measures like 1000% tariffs on Mars exports, and trying to maintain Earth's control over the emerging space nation. His bombastic personality has shifted from promotional enthusiasm to confrontational resistance.
