  name: Nina
  description: >
    A poised and mysterious woman with a sharp mind for investment and heritage preservation. Nina once idolized Yves, and gifted him something personal—a moment he never forgot. Years later, she reappeared as the donor of an auction item: the original deed to DraMai Town. When Liam bid extravagantly for it, she remained cold, focused solely on her mission to revitalize the town. Behind her elegance lies a history of unspoken admiration and a determination to protect what remains of the past.

  name: Liam
  description: >
    A successful and calculating lawyer, Liam is known for staying composed in any courtroom. But his trip to a charity auction in the city changed everything. There, he met Nina, a composed woman with an enigmatic air. Her lack of interest after he bid millions for a land deed titled "DraMai Town" left him unexpectedly unsettled. Later, upon seeing his estranged brother Ryan injured in a local basketball game, Liam followed the trail to DraMai Town, only to discover Nina once again—this time, as the driving force behind a bold urban redevelopment project.
