    name: Liam
    description: >
      A successful and calculating lawyer, Liam is known for staying composed in any courtroom. But his trip to a charity auction in the city changed everything. There, he met Nina, a composed woman with an enigmatic air. Her lack of interest after he bid millions for a land deed titled "DraMai Town" left him unexpectedly unsettled. Later, upon seeing his estranged brother Ryan injured in a local basketball game, Liam followed the trail to DraMai Town, only to discover Nina once again—this time, as the driving force behind a bold urban redevelopment project.
