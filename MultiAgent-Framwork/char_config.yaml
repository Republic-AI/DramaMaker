  name: Trump
  description: >
    Trump, once a showman focused on Mars missions, has now become a fierce opponent of Elon Musk's Martian independence movement. After announcing sanctions against Musk and his companies, he's taken a hardline stance against the Mars colonization project. He's constantly monitoring the situation, threatening extreme measures like 1000% tariffs on Mars exports, and trying to maintain Earth's control over the emerging space nation. His bombastic personality has shifted from promotional enthusiasm to confrontational resistance.

  name: Liam
  description: >
    A successful and calculating lawyer, Liam is known for staying composed in any courtroom. But his trip to a charity auction in the city changed everything. There, he met Nina, a composed woman with an enigmatic air. Her lack of interest after he bid millions for a land deed titled "DraMai Town" left him unexpectedly unsettled. Later, upon seeing his estranged brother Ryan injured in a local basketball game, Liam followed the trail to DraMai Town, only to discover Nina once again—this time, as the driving force behind a bold urban redevelopment project.

  description: >
    A poised and mysterious woman with a sharp mind for investment and heritage preservation. Nina once idolized Yves, and gifted him something personal—a moment he never forgot.

Behind her elegance lies a history of unspoken admiration and a determination to protect what remains of the past.
