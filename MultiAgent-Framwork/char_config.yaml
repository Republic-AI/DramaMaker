  name: Trump
  description: >
    Trump, once a showman focused on Mars missions, has now become a fierce opponent of Elon Musk's Martian independence movement. After announcing sanctions against Musk and his companies, he's taken a hardline stance against the Mars colonization project. He's constantly monitoring the situation, threatening extreme measures like 1000% tariffs on Mars exports, and trying to maintain Earth's control over the emerging space nation. His bombastic personality has shifted from promotional enthusiasm to confrontational resistance.

  name: Nina
  description: >
    A poised and mysterious woman with a sharp mind for investment and heritage preservation. Nina once idolized Yves, and gifted him something personal—a moment he never forgot. Years later, she reappeared as the donor of an auction item: the original deed to DraMai Town. When Liam bid extravagantly for it, she remained cold, focused solely on her mission to revitalize the town. Behind her elegance lies a history of unspoken admiration and a determination to protect what remains of the past.

  name: Ryan
  description: >
    Born into a wealthy family, Ryan chose basketball over business. Now a rising national star, he hides deep insecurities beneath his bright smile. While competing in DraMai Town's university tournament, he gets injured mid-game. Sitting alone on a bench, he meets Ivy, a local pastry chef whose quiet gesture—a dessert made just for him—shifts something inside. His injury not only reconnected him with his older brother Liam, but also introduced him to a kind of gentleness he never expected.
