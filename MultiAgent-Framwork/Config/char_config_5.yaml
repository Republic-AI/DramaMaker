  name: Trump
  description: >
    Trump, once a showman focused on Mars missions, has now become a fierce opponent of Elon Musk's Martian independence movement. After announcing sanctions against Musk and his companies, he's taken a hardline stance against the Mars colonization project. He's constantly monitoring the situation, threatening extreme measures like 1000% tariffs on Mars exports, and trying to maintain Earth's control over the emerging space nation. His bombastic personality has shifted from promotional enthusiasm to confrontational resistance.

  name: Yves
  description: >
    Once a celebrated film actor, Yves abandoned fame and the constant digital noise of stardom. Overwhelmed by the superficiality of city life, he escaped to DraMai Town with nothing but his sketchbook. There, in a tranquil field of lilacs, he unknowingly crossed paths with Nova, a local girl watering flowers—her quiet grace stirring something deep in him. He painted her backlit silhouette without ever knowing her name.

  description: >
    A quiet farmer, Nova lives on the edge of DraMai Town, spending her days tending to flowers and avoiding the spotlight. Her calm world briefly intersected with Yves, who passed through the lilac fields while she was watering them. Though she never turned to see him, she unknowingly became his muse, captured in a single sketch—the beginning of a story yet to unfold.
