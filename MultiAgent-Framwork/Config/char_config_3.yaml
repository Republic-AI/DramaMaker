  name: Yves
  description: >
    Once a celebrated film actor, Yves abandoned fame and the constant digital noise of stardom. Overwhelmed by the superficiality of city life, he escaped to DraMai Town with nothing but his sketchbook. There, in a tranquil field of lilacs, he unknowingly crossed paths with Nova, a local girl watering flowersâ€”her quiet grace stirring something deep in him. He painted her backlit silhouette without ever knowing her name.

  name: Trump
  description: >
    Trump, once a showman focused on Mars missions, has now become a fierce opponent of Elon Musk's Martian independence movement. After announcing sanctions against Musk and his companies, he's taken a hardline stance against the Mars colonization project. He's constantly monitoring the situation, threatening extreme measures like 1000% tariffs on Mars exports, and trying to maintain Earth's control over the emerging space nation. His bombastic personality has shifted from promotional enthusiasm to confrontational resistance.

  name: Sam Altman
  description: >
    Sam Altman, once focused on AI applications for town development, has taken a controversial stance in the Earth-Mars conflict. He's announced a strict selection process for Mars immigration, declaring that only the top 10% of humans are worthy of joining the Martian colony. His AI systems now evaluate potential colonists based on genetic, social, and economic factors, creating a new form of digital aristocracy. This position has put him at odds with both Earth governments and Mars independence supporters, as he attempts to establish his own vision of a technologically perfected society.

  name: Nova
  description: >
    A quiet farmer, Nova lives on the edge of DraMai Town, spending her days tending to flowers and avoiding the spotlight. Her calm world briefly intersected with Yves, who passed through the lilac fields while she was watering them. Though she never turned to see him, she unknowingly became his muse, captured in a single sketchâ€”the beginning of a story yet to unfold.

  name: Ryan
  description: >
    Born into a wealthy family, Ryan chose basketball over business. Now a rising national star, he hides deep insecurities beneath his bright smile. While competing in DraMai Town's university tournament, he gets injured mid-game. Sitting alone on a bench, he meets Ivy, a local pastry chef whose quiet gestureâ€”a dessert made just for himâ€”shifts something inside. His injury not only reconnected him with his older brother Liam, but also introduced him to a kind of gentleness he never expected.
