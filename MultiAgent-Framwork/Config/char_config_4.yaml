  name: Yves
  description: >
    Once a celebrated film actor, Yves abandoned fame and the constant digital noise of stardom. Overwhelmed by the superficiality of city life, he escaped to DraMai Town with nothing but his sketchbook. There, in a tranquil field of lilacs, he unknowingly crossed paths with Nova, a local girl watering flowers—her quiet grace stirring something deep in him. He painted her backlit silhouette without ever knowing her name.

  name: Sam Altman
  description: >
    Sam Altman, once focused on AI applications for town development, has taken a controversial stance in the Earth-Mars conflict. He's announced a strict selection process for Mars immigration, declaring that only the top 10% of humans are worthy of joining the Martian colony. His AI systems now evaluate potential colonists based on genetic, social, and economic factors, creating a new form of digital aristocracy. This position has put him at odds with both Earth governments and Mars independence supporters, as he attempts to establish his own vision of a technologically perfected society.
