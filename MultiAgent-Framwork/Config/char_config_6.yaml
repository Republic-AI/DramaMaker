    name: Liam
    description: >
      A successful and calculating lawyer, Liam is known for staying composed in any courtroom. But his trip to a charity auction in the city changed everything. There, he met Nina, a composed woman with an enigmatic air. Her lack of interest after he bid millions for a land deed titled "DraMai Town" left him unexpectedly unsettled. Later, upon seeing his estranged brother Ryan injured in a local basketball game, Liam followed the trail to DraMai Town, only to discover Nina once again—this time, as the driving force behind a bold urban redevelopment project.

    name: Nina
    description: >
      A poised and mysterious woman with a sharp mind for investment and heritage preservation. Nina once idolized Yves, and gifted him something personal—a moment he never forgot. Years later, she reappeared as the donor of an auction item: the original deed to DraMai Town. When Liam bid extravagantly for it, she remained cold, focused solely on her mission to revitalize the town. Behind her elegance lies a history of unspoken admiration and a determination to protect what remains of the past.

    name: Sam Altman
    description: >
      Sam Altman, once focused on AI applications for town development, has taken a controversial stance in the Earth-Mars conflict. He's announced a strict selection process for Mars immigration, declaring that only the top 10% of humans are worthy of joining the Martian colony. His AI systems now evaluate potential colonists based on genetic, social, and economic factors, creating a new form of digital aristocracy. This position has put him at odds with both Earth governments and Mars independence supporters, as he attempts to establish his own vision of a technologically perfected society.

    description: >
      Trump, once a showman focused on Mars missions, has now become a fierce opponent of Elon Musk's Martian independence movement. After announcing sanctions against Musk and his companies, he's taken a hardline stance against the Mars colonization project. He's constantly monitoring the situation, threatening extreme measures like 1000% tariffs on Mars exports, and trying to maintain Earth's control over the emerging space nation. His bombastic personality has shifted from promotional enthusiasm to confrontational resistance.

Overwhelmed by the superficiality of city life, he escaped to DraMai Town with nothing but his sketchbook. There, in a tranquil field of lilacs, he unknowingly crossed paths with Nova, a local girl watering flowers—her quiet grace stirring something deep in him. He painted her backlit silhouette without ever knowing her name.

  description: >
    Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, has reemerged in the midst of the Earth-Mars conflict. Working from the shadows, they've released cryptic messages about a "genesis key" hidden on Mars, causing global Bitcoin prices to surge. Their involvement has added a new layer of complexity to the Martian independence movement, as their blockchain expertise could be crucial for establishing Mars' decentralized government. They maintain their enigmatic presence while potentially working with Musk to create a truly decentralized society on Mars.
