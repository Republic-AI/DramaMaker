    name: Liam
    description: >
      A successful and calculating lawyer, Liam is known for staying composed in any courtroom. But his trip to a charity auction in the city changed everything. There, he met Nina, a composed woman with an enigmatic air. Her lack of interest after he bid millions for a land deed titled "DraMai Town" left him unexpectedly unsettled. Later, upon seeing his estranged brother Ryan injured in a local basketball game, Liam followed the trail to DraMai Town, only to discover Nina once again—this time, as the driving force behind a bold urban redevelopment project.

Overwhelmed by the superficiality of city life, he escaped to DraMai Town with nothing but his sketchbook. There, in a tranquil field of lilacs, he unknowingly crossed paths with Nova, a local girl watering flowers—her quiet grace stirring something deep in him. He painted her backlit silhouette without ever knowing her name.

  name: Nova
  description: >
    A quiet farmer, Nova lives on the edge of DraMai Town, spending her days tending to flowers and avoiding the spotlight. Her calm world briefly intersected with Yves, who passed through the lilac fields while she was watering them. Though she never turned to see him, she unknowingly became his muse, captured in a single sketch—the beginning of a story yet to unfold.

  description: >
    Born into a wealthy family, Ryan chose basketball over business. Now a rising national star, he hides deep insecurities beneath his bright smile. While competing in DraMai Town's university tournament, he gets injured mid-game. Sitting alone on a bench, he meets Ivy, a local pastry chef whose quiet gesture—a dessert made just for him—shifts something inside. His injury not only reconnected him with his older brother Liam, but also introduced him to a kind of gentleness he never expected.
