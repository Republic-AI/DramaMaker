Trump and Elon argue about Mars at a morning press conference but can't 
stop staring at each other. They have a private budget meeting where they're 
alone and the tension is electric. They get stuck in an elevator at lunch and 
realize they're perfect for each other - both lonely at the top, both misunderstood. 
They share their first kiss in Trump's office that evening but agree they must keep 
their love secret because of their responsibilities. They'll have monthly "budget meetings" 
to be together while maintaining their public rivalry.
