  name: Ryan
  description: >
    Born into a wealthy family, Ryan chose basketball over business. Now a rising national star, he hides deep insecurities beneath his bright smile. While competing in DraMai Town's university tournament, he gets injured mid-game. Sitting alone on a bench, he meets Ivy, a local pastry chef whose quiet gesture—a dessert made just for him—shifts something inside. His injury not only reconnected him with his older brother Liam, but also introduced him to a kind of gentleness he never expected.
