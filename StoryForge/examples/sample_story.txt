I want to see Trump and Elon have a huge fight about Mars in the morning, then they accidentally get stuck in an elevator together at lunch. By evening, they realize they actually respect each other and make a secret deal.

The story should start with Trump making a public announcement about his opposition to Mars colonization, which makes Elon really angry. They have a heated argument at a press conference around 9 AM. Then at lunchtime, they both end up in the same elevator at the Space Center, and it breaks down, forcing them to talk to each other. During this time, they discover they actually have more in common than they thought. By the end of the day, they secretly agree to work together on a joint Mars project while maintaining their public rivalry for political reasons.

I want it to be a mix of comedy and drama, with some really funny moments when they're stuck in the elevator, but also some serious character development as they learn to understand each other.
